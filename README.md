ðŸ”Ž **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

## Run the Angular app
Run `ng serve pfe` to run the angular app locally on http://localhost:4200/.

## Run the Nest app
Run `ng serve api` to start the Nest server locally on http://localhost:3333/api.

âš  *Important* : so that we don't run into any CORS issues while developing, a proxy configuration is set to proxy requests to http://localhost:4200/api to the NestJS server.

## Run the whole stack
Run `npm run dev` to start the Nest app and the Angular app concurrently.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> I have already generated the api-interfaces library containing the modals used in our app.

Libraries are sharable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@gl4/mylib`.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.
In our case we have 2 apps that we work on: 
- api
- pfe
